# WTT-Bridge

Synchronize your conversations between Whatsapp and Telegram. 

To make it as seamless as possible, WTT-Bridge will simulate conversations on Telegram by creating a separate group chat for each Whatsapp conversation and forward all messages accordingly.
Each such Whatsapp conversation on Telegram has the prefix "[WA]" in the title.
